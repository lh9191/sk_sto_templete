                                    SECURITIES</p>
                                <p>The securities made available through Potens are offered to you in reliance
                                    on the exemption under section 272A(1) of the Securities and Futures Act
                                    (“SFA”). These offers are not made in or accompanied by a prospectus that is
                                    registered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the “Authority”).</p>
                                <p>You should NOT invest in the securities offered unless you fully understand
                                    the risks and are prepared to take the risks. You should carefully consider
                                    whether this investment is suitable for you in light of your knowledge and
                                    experience in financial and business matters, investment objectives, financial
                                    means and the risks that you are prepared to take.</p>
                                <p>The risks of investing in such securities include but are not limited to the
                                    following: </p>
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>100% loss on such investments:</dt>
                                    <dd>There is a high risk that you may lose all your money on such
                                        investments. Investments available through Potens may include the
                                        shares or debt securities of early-stage companies or companies
                                        without a proven track record. The risk of business failure is high. For
                                        every 10 new businesses formed in Singapore, 7 to 8 would cease
                                        operations in the same year*. There is therefore a high risk that you
                                        may lose 100% of your investment. </dd>
                                    <dt>Difficult to cash in or exit such investments:</dt>
                                    <dd>It may be difficult or even impossible for you to cash in on or exit such
                                        investments. Such investments are subject to resale restrictions set out
                                        in section 272A(8) of the SFA, and there may not be a secondary
                                        market for them. </dd>
                                    <dt>Risks of equities investments:</dt>
                                    <dd>If such investments are in shares, you may not receive a dividend, and
                                        your shareholdings could be significantly diluted if new shares are
                                        issued. In addition, if the shares are unpaid or partly paid, you will still
                                        be liable to pay the remaining amount to the company. </dd>
                                    <dt>Online platform/facility failure:</dt>
                                    <dd>If the online platform/facility handles your money, you may also lose all
                                        your money in this investment if the online platform/facility fails and
                                        becomes insolvent. </dd>
                                    <dt>Risks of investing in foreign issuers:</dt>
                                    <dd>If such investments are offered by an issuer in a foreign jurisdiction,
                                        your investment will be subject to the laws and regulations of that
                                        jurisdiction. You may also be subject to additional tax liabilities,
                                        transaction costs and capital controls. </dd>

                                    <dd>You may not have sufficient information to make fully informed
                                        investment decisions. There is no statutory obligation for issuers or
                                        intermediaries to provide you with information that you would
                                        reasonably require to make informed assessments of offers being made

                                        you invest in will be accurate or accessible:</dt>
