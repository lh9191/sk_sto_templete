                                <p><span class="underline">Successors and assigns</span>: These General Terms will bind you and us and our

                                <p><span class="underline">Translation</span>: If these Terms are translated into a language other than English,

                                <p><span class="underline">Rights of Third Parties</span>: A person or entity who is not a party to these General

                                    For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this clause shall affect the rights of any
